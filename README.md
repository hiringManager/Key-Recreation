## Additional **Info:**
**Direct Bitting Code -**
If a key has a number on it (stamped), that is most likely a **direct bitting code**, a code to replicate it with no effort. (The literal bitting to recreate)

**Blind Code -**
If the first code isn't the correct one, it is a **blind code** and you can find lookup tables for them. (lockcodes.com or "Instacode" Locksmithing software) 
Example: Masterlock key has 3188 stamped on it, lookup table reveals that cuts are 6136.
**You can also find blind codes on the actual lock**  Masterlocks will frequently have a four-digit code stamped on the bottom, which you can use a lookup table for.

**Keyway Profile** -
If it's an uncommon key (corporate, rare, or specialized) you can have issues figuring out the **keyway profile**, the shape when looking at it from the end.

Your photo can also be **absolute dogshit,** video, etc but will need more post-processing and effort.
